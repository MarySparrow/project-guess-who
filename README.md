# Project 5, (week 5) - Guess Who 

Create the classic board game "Guess Who", using javascript. 

## The problem

Followed a step by step approach as per provided instructions from Technigo brief. I struggled from the start, this assignment has been very stressful and not understanding the steps needed to make it work, overthinking and blocking myself from getting anywhere. For me this assignment actually felt harder with the pre-set code, as I could'nt understand its functions properly. 

I asked many questions in Slack and Stack, also discussing with team members, google and slowly I managed to understand the functions and why they were needed and what needed to be added. 

If I had more time I would complete red level.
